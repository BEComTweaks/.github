We are a team that manages an open-source version of BedrockTweaks, a continuation of DrAv's [Bedrock Tweaks](https://bedrocktweaks.net)

A live demo is available at [bedrocktweaks.github.io](https://bedrocktweaks.github.io)

**Note: Behaviour Packs and Crafting Tweaks do not have their own server set up. YzaBeast1 is working on merging the servers to run on his computer, so it will take a while for that to work. Try resource packs**
